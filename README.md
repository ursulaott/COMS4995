project proposal

description: 
- a library of photo editing/filter effects in python that are free, easy to use, and highly fine-tune-able (kind of like lightroom presets)
- plan to make a cli tool first, and then maybe build a web interface
- anyone can create and add their own effects to the library 

motivation: 
- as an amatuer photographer i have tried almost every photo editing app/software and the free ones are not very customizable and the good ones are very expensive
- existing image processing libraries i have tried are too complicated and not really geared to artistic effects or just straight up ugly 
- i really just hate adobe as a company and want to make this to spite them
